=================

Welcome to the repo for my personal website hosted under krishnaregmi.me .  Unfortunately krishnaregmi.com was already taken by somebody else, so I had to get the .me website. No Big Deal!!

I will use this website to talk about my side projects, the logic behind them, and what problem they try to solve. 

A quick intro about me - I am educated in Mechanical Engineering, do Half software development and half mechanlical engineering type work at my day job and enjoy solving problems. At home, I spend most of the time writing django apps.

Why Django - No specific reason, except it lets me build apps extremely fast. I can very easily reuse the apps from one project to the other, which honestly saves me a so much time. The more django apps I write, the better I get, which encourages me to write more. Its a awesome cycle. Ocasionally, I will release generic django apps that people can use. 

I have done small amout of node when it was v < 1 . Node is at V 4.0 now, and I am planning on writing node apps in the near future. Keep up for the updates. 

More updates to follow soon.
